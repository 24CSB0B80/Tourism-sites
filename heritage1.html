Our first World Heritage site in Maharashtra is one of India’s most recent additions: the Victorian Gothic and Art Deco Ensembles of Mumbai. Located in the Fort area of downtown Mumbai, this collection of 94 beautiful buildings date from the 19th and early 20th centuries. They’re a a legacy of the British colonial period. Rich with cash from exports, the local government built enormous grand buildings to make the city of Bombay world-renowned.

And there’s some incredible buildings here. Particular highlights of the Victorian Gothic style include the Bombay High Court, and the University of Mumbai. There’s also the City Civil and Sessions building, plus the incredible Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station. If you can believe it – the CST railway station is also a separate World Heritage Site!

Nearby, around the famous Oval Maidan cricket grounds, stand Mumbai’s beautiful Art Deco buildings. Unfortunately, most are residential and not open to the public, so they’re difficult to fully appreciate. But they’re still impressive, and are an integral part of modern, global Mumbai.
